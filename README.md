## What is ArtemisCryptoBotðŸ¤– ?

In the abundance of data amidst the unprecedented hype in the cryptocurrency space, this is an attempt to aggregate publicly available information into a single Telegram endpoint. We continuously integrate new features or third-party APIs that we discover along the way in order to stay up-to-date.

## How to use?

It is essentially a Telegram chatbot that you can interact with. To send a command you have to add a `/` prefix followed by the command name and any arguments (if needed), e.g. `/p bitcoin` to query the current price of bitcoin or `/trending` for a list of currently trending coins on Coingecko. For a list of available commands, see below.

## Resources

Currently our hosting resources are limited and request limits may apply. We have plans to scale up according to the growth of our community.

## Pricing

As of now, all endpoints are free to use as they comply with the terms of service (ToS) of the third-party APIs that are invoked. However, we are working on some proprietary features based on free market data that may come under a premium plan soon.

## Why Telegram?

Primarily because Telegram is the dominant means of communication in the crypto space. **Period**.

It also offers an awesome API to build custom applications on and serves as a personalized Instant Messenger (IM) so that users may receive customized notifications.
