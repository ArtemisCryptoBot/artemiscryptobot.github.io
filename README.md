## What is ArtemisCryptoBotðŸ¤– ?

In the abundance of data amidst the unprecedented hype in the cryptocurrency space, this is an attempt to aggregate publicly available information into a single Telegram endpoint. We will be continuously integrating new features or third-party APIs that we discover along the way in order to stay up-to-date.

## How to use?

It is essentially a Telegram chatbot so you first need to create a [Telegram](https://telegram.org/) account. Then either [click here](https://t.me/artemis_crypto_bot) or manually search for `artemis_crypto_bot` on Telegram to start. To send a command you have to type the `/` prefix followed by the command name and any arguments (if needed), e.g. `/p bitcoin` to query the current price of bitcoin or `/trending` for a list of currently trending coins on [Coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com/). For a list of available commands, [see below](#list-of-supported-free-endpoints).

## Resources

Our hosting resources are currently limited and request limits may apply. Bot responses may be occasionally slowed down depending on the traffic but we have plans to scale up the necessary resources according to the growth of our community.

## Pricing

As of now, all endpoints are free to use as they comply with the terms-of-service of the third-party APIs that are invoked under the hood. However, we are working on some proprietary features based on freely accesible blockchain data that may come under a premium plan soon.

## Why Telegram?

Because Telegram is the dominant means of communication in the crypto space. **Period**.

It also offers an awesome API to build custom applications on and serves as a personalized Instant Messenger (IM) so that users may receive customized notifications.
